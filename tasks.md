## Simple Proof of stake blockchain

https://naivecoinstake.learn.uno/

01. Minimal working blockchain
- Define block and blockchain
- Methods to add new blocks to the blockchain with arbitrary data
    - generateNextBlock
    - storage?
    - validateBlock method
    - validateChain method
    - replaceChain method , replace if it's longer than our chain and it's valid
- Blockchain nodes that communicate and sync the blockchain with other nodes
- A simple HTTP API to control the node

02. Proof of Stake
- minting process, block generation https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/05/stake/

03. Transactions, wallets and transaction pool
